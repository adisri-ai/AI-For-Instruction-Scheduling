# Project Overview  
1. This project aims at optimizing the exectuion sequence for various nodes of a given Control Flow Graph(CFG) using LSTM deep learning model in order to minimize clock cycles.
2. We use personality-based Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) deep learning model for this which is used to identify the patterns in user's multiple codes and classify the user into
   among the defined personality classes of coder.
3. This followed by performing branch prediction on the a given code based on the personality it is classified into. Performing branch prediction helps reducing number of clock cycles needed.
